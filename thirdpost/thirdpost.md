<a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> is a cross-platform, free and open-source game engine released under the MIT license.

Godot allows video game developers to create 3D and 2D games using multiple programming languages, such as C++, C# and GDscript. It makes use of a hierarchy of nodes to facilitate the development experience. Classes can be derived from a node type to create more specialized node types that inherit behavior. Nodes are organized inside of "scenes", which are reusable, instanceable, inheritable, and nestable groups of nodes. All game resources, including scripts and graphical assets, are saved as part of the computer's file system (rather than in a database).

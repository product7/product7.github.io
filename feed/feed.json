It makes use of a hierarchy of nodes to facilitate the development experience. Classes can be derived from a node type to create more specialized node types that inherit behavior. Nodes are organized inside of &quot;scenes&quot;, which are reusable, instanceable, inheritable, and nestable groups of nodes. All game resources, including scripts and graphical assets, are saved as part of the computer's file system (rather than in a database).</p>\n",
